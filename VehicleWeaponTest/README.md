This demo requires CustomParticleLoader, CustomParticleLoaderMultiExplosion, CustomParticleLoaderSpawnEntity, FullautoLauncher, ParticleScriptTest, CustomPlayerActionManager and VehicleWeapon, since a lot resources are shared during my test.

AND here's the trial for you: make the turret on top of the taxi working on driver seat. Then you should have an overall understanding of the whole system.
